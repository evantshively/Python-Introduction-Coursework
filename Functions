Python Introduction Work

''' 
Understanding and Using Functions:

Pseudocode for a function in Python, how it works

begins with def (definition) 

def function_name(Parameter List):
    statements -> function body
    return -> statement
    
Functions are First Class Objects: 
You can treat this as a variable, or pass as an arguement for another function,
or even return them as values from other functions 

'''

#simple function

def greet(name):
    print("Hi " + name)

#Now we will call the above greet function 

playerName = input("Hello what is your name?: ")   
greet(playerName)

def welcome(character):
    print("Hello " + character + "," + " Welcome to the Game!")

characterName = input("Please enter your character name: ")
welcome(characterName)

# You can also accomplish the same idea by attaching it to a variable

varGreet = greet("Evan")

print(varGreet)

How to create basic math functions and use the return command

'''
def fahrenheit(T_in_celsius):
    return (T_in_celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
    
# return command returns the output

print(fahrenheit(25))

# We can also use variables within the function to return our value

def fahrenheit2(T_in_celsius2):
    valReturn = (T_in_celsius2)
    return valReturn

print(fahrenheit2(27))

# You can use the pass command to null the operation

# How to run mulitple data points through the function

for t in (22.6, 25.7, 28, 32, 29): 
    print(t, ":", fahrenheit(t))

# Continued pratice

def times5(number):
    numberTimesFive = number * 5
    return numberTimesFive

for n in (7, 9, 10, 11, 15):
    print(n, ':', times5(n))
