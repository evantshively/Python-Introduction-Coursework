'''
Algorithms make it necessary for a programming language to 
have a construction which makes it possible to carry out a sequence 
of statements repeatedly. 

Loops: 
-Count-controlled loops: for(i=0; i <= n; i++) -This structure is not Python Code
-Condition-controlled loop - while loop and do while loop

Pseudo Code: 
While (condition is true) 
    do something 
    % Note: The "something" should eventually result
    % in the condition being false

Loops 1: A while loop
'''

#Example of a while loop
# The following example calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100
n = 100
total_sum = 0
counter = 1 
while (counter <= n):
    total_sum = total_sum + counter # += counter
    print(total_sum)
    counter += 1 # come back 2
    print(counter)

print("Sum of 1 until " + str(n) + " results in " + str(total_sum))

Loops 2 : if, elif, and else loops

We will create a number guessing game to show how to use these different commands in loops

'''

import random  # module that allows the creation of random events
upper_bound = 20 # set our two bonds for our random number to guess
lower_bound = 1


rndNumber = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound) # Uses random module to store a randNumber between 1 and 20
guess = 0
while guess != rndNumber:
    guess = int(input("Guess New Number: "))
    if guess > 0:
        if guess > rndNumber:
            print("Number too large")
        elif guess < rndNumber:
            print("Number too small")
    else:
        print("Sorry that you're giving up")
        break
else:    # If none of the conditions are met the loop will go here. 
    print("You made it!")

Loops 3: More loop examples
Creating a while Loop that averages multiple numbers
'''

# Keep asking for numbers until count numbers have been entered
#prints the average value 

sum = 0.0
print("This program will take several numbers then average them.")
count = int(input("How many numbers would you like to average: "))
current_count = 0 

while current_count < count:
    current_count = current_count + 1 # this prevents the loop from running endlessly
    number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    sum = sum + number
    
print("The average was: ", sum / count)
